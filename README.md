Using R to perform clustering on the iris data set for computer system evaluation course

1.	Remove the species column from the iris data set (name it as Short-Data).
2.	Apply K-means clustering algorithm on Short-Data with number of clusters as 3.
3.	Append the cluster number to each row of data (Short-Data).
4.	Display the aggregate data (Short-Data) with cluster number.
5.	Calculate “within group sum of the squares” for the above clustering.
6.	Calculate and plot Silhouette Coefficient for the clusters created using k-means
